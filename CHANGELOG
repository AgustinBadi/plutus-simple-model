## [0.5.0.0] - 2022-12-18

### Changed

- `Contract.spend'`,`Contract.sendValue`, `Contract.withSpend`, `Contract.spend` wil now not spend UTxOs that have a datum.

## [0.4.1.0] - 2022-12-13

### Fixed

- A bug which caused the blockchain to go into an infinite loop upon thowing an
  error

## [0.4.0.0] - 2022-12-13

### Changed

- The behaviour of various functions with regard to reference scripts has
  changed.

  Mainly, the special treatment given to UTxOs with reference scripts has been
  removed. This enables using UTxOs that hold both value/datums and a reference
  script.

  - `Mock.mockUtxos` now includes UTxOs with reference scripts

  - `Mock.mockRefScripts` is now a function rather than a record
    field

  - `Contract.valueAt`, `Contract.checkBalance`, `Contract.checkBalanceBy`, `Contract.utxoAt`, `Contract.boxAt`, `Contract.withUtxo`, `Pretty.ppBalanceSheet` and the `Pretty` instance for `Mock` will now include outputs that have reference scripts.

  - `Contract.spend'`,`Contract.sendValue`, `Contract.withSpend`, `Contract.spend` will not spend a UTxO that has a reference script.

  - The behaviour of `Mock.getTxOut`, `Mock.getUTxO`, `Mock.datumAt`, `Mock.getHashDatum`, `Mock.submitTx` and similar is unchanged.
